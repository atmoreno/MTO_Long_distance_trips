# MTO_project

The objective of this part of the MTO project is to describe the long distance travel behavior on the Ontario province.
The possible choices of the behavior are: at home, long distance daytrip, long distance inbound travel and long distance away.
There are 3 main trip purposes: leisure, visit and business.

The order to run the files are:

1- mlogit_summer_v1.R
    Commands in R to estimate the probability of choosing one of the options, depending on the trip purpose.
    The difference on the models for each trip purpose is how the variable "SEASON" is coded.
    
2- mlogit_gender.R
    Commands in R to estimate the difference on the probability of choosing one of the options, depending on the trip purpose depending on how the variable "GENDER" is coded.
